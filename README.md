# Student-Performance-Predictor
# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

A Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s final grade (G3) using academic and behavioral features.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict student academic performance based on:

- First period grade (G1)
- Second period grade (G2)
- Study time
- Absences
- Failures
- Age

The model is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
